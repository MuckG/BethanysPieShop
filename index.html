                        <p>
                            Welcome to <b>Bethany's Pie Shop</b>, where pie-baking perfection meets
                            convenience! For countless years, Bethany's passion for crafting the most
                            scrumptious pies has been an unmatched delight. Our journey began in 2013
                            when we unveiled our first charming store in the heart of Brussuls
                            (Belgium), nestled in a cozy little street near the illustrious Grand
                            Market. It was here that our pies first captured the hearts and taste buds
                            of people from every corner of the globe, from the delectable soft cakes to
                            heavenly cheesecakes and tantalizingly spiced apple pies. <i>Our store's
                            extraordinary success was nothing short of a culinary fairy tale.</i>

                        <p>
                            As the demand for Bethany's divine creations soared, an incredible milestole was
                            reached in 2015, when we proudly sold an astonishingly 100 pies each day!
                            Naturally, our beloved Pie Shop had to evolve, and we relocatd to a 
                            grander, more spacious building to better serve our cherished patrons. The 
                            love and support we received from our ever-growing community inspirted us to
                            explore new possibilities.

                            In response to numerous heartfelt requests from pie enthusiasts far and wide,
                            we knew the time had come to bring our mouthwatering treats to your doorstep.
                            Thus, in 2023, the idea of our very own webstore was born - a virtual haven
                            where you can now relish the delight of ordering Bethany's scrumptious pies
